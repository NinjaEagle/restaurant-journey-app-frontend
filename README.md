Restaurant Journey is a click-through game created using NYC OpenDataâ€™s Restaurant Inspection Results as an API. The game allows you to select restaurants in each borough and the goal is to get through all five boroughs without getting sick.

The Backend is located at: https://github.com/Franchely/restaurant-journey-app-backend

Results are on the leaderboard in which you can see who was ranked as the healthiest player on the top.

** Also, be sure to run `yarn add semantic-ui-react` in terminal before you start. **
